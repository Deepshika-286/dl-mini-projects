# Deep Learning Mini Projects
This repository contains a set of deep learning mini-projects implemented using TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. Each week focuses on foundational to intermediate-level deep learning concepts with hands-on coding examples.

## Linear Regression (TensorFlow)
- Built a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow.

- Generated synthetic data for training and testing.

- Model was trained to learn the relation: y = 2x + 3.

- Evaluated the model and predicted values for new inputs.

## Deep Learning Packages Overview
- Explored the basics of TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

- Built a basic neural network using Keras for binary classification.

- Included simple TensorFlow operations to understand computation graphs.

## Sentiment Analysis using LSTM
- Used the IMDB movie review dataset for binary sentiment classification.

- Built an LSTM-based neural network using Keras.

- Preprocessed reviews by tokenizing and padding sequences.

- Achieved classification of reviews into positive or negative sentiments.

## Language Modeling using RNN
- Implemented a word-level RNN language model using a sample text.

- Used tokenization and n-gram sequence generation.

- Trained an RNN (LSTM) to predict the next word in a sequence.

- Demonstrated text generation using a trained model and a seed input.

## Sentiment Analysis using GRU
- Built a GRU-based model for sentiment classification on the IMDB dataset.

- Preprocessed data similarly to LSTM model (tokenizing and padding).

- Included functionality to predict sentiment for unseen text using the trained model.

- Compared performance with the LSTM-based approach.

## Image Classification with Transfer Learning
- Used VGG16 pre-trained model for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

- Implemented Transfer Learning by freezing base layers and adding custom dense layers.

- Fine-tuned the top layers to classify images into 10 categories.

- Evaluated accuracy and loss on test data.

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python 3

- TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch

- NumPy, Matplotlib

- scikit-learn (for preprocessing)

- nltk, spaCy (for NLP tasks)
## Notes
All code is written in Python and can be run in Jupyter Notebook, Colab, or any Python IDE.

Designed for educational purposes to learn and experiment with deep learning fundamentals.
